# Coursera React Honors Project- Artist Spotlight

This is my Coursera React Honors Project, which I named Artist Spotlight.

It is a simple react webpage that displays artists in a card form on the front screen- a card can be selected and an artist page is rendered.  

From the artist page, an artwork card can be selected, and it will take the user to a display page with a larger version of the artwork and some descriptive info (Artist, artwork title, description). The user can get back to the user page using the “back to artist page” link at the bottom of the page.  

The about us and contact us pages can be accessed from the home page header/nav bar and will take you to pages to describe the company and how to contact (currently using Lorem Ipsum in place of real information).
